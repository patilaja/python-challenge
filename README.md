# python-challenge- Python Challenge Work

## PyBank

Challange Statment: In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be working on financial data file -PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.  

Solve for: Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset

  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
